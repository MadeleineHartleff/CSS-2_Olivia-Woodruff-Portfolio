# Olivia Woodruff Portfolio

This project is a CSS-based styling exercise designed to enhance a photography 
portfolio webpage. Using various CSS visual rules, the project improves text 
alignment, colors, font styles, and the overall visual appeal of the page through 
customized backgrounds and styling elements.

## Credits

This project is based on an exercise from

While the task description and the index.html file were provided by Codecademy, 
the CSS file and its styling were fully implemented by me.
